# kickstart-modular.nvim (Tiago's Version)

## Introduction

*This is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that moves from a single file to a multi file configuration.*

## Installation & Other stuff

- Please refer to [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)

## Notes

#### I frequently switch between `gruvbox-material` and `rose-pine`.
#### I customize the colors of lualine's setup. The modifications are in `lua/lualine/themes`
#### I don't like background on my status line, so the modifications essentially remove it.
